' --- Relationships ---

Op --> MissionController : Configure Mission / Provide Destination
MissionController --> FlightCtrl : Send Flight Commands
MissionController --> SensorMgr : Activate / Deactivate Sensors
SensorMgr --> PathPlanner : Send Mine Detection Data
PathPlanner --> FlightCtrl : Send Updated Path / Waypoints
PathPlanner --> DataLogger : Log Mine Coordinates
DataLogger --> ControlStation : Transmit Path & Mine Data
ControlStation --> FlyerModule : Send Generated Flyer Data
MissionController --> FlyerModule : Switch to Flyer Mode
FlyerModule --> User : Distribute Safe Path Flyers

' --- Notes ---
note right of PathPlanner
  Uses ML algorithms to calculate
  the safest path avoiding mines.
end note

note bottom of ControlStation
  Generates flyers showing safe routes
  and transmits them to the drone for delivery.
end note
